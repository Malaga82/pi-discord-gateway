A lightweight Discord gateway for [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). SQLite-backed queue, per-channel session isolation, crash recovery, abort support. One command to set up, runs as a daemon, and keeps task and delivery state across restarts.

**Latest release: 2.0.0.** Requires Node.js ≥22.19.0 and pi ≥0.83.0 <0.88.0. See [upgrade and recovery](#task-recovery-and-delivery) before updating from 1.x, and [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.

```bash
npm install -g piscord
piscord setup                 # interactive wizard -- walks you through everything
```

That's it. The setup wizard checks prerequisites, asks for your Discord bot token, lets you pick a channel policy, and optionally installs + starts a background service. Your bot is live in under a minute.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 22.19.0 (floor imposed by the pi peer packages, not by gateway code)
- **Linux, macOS, or Windows**
- **[pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)** ≥ 0.83.0 and < 0.88.0 installed and on `PATH` (recommended: 0.87.0), with a configured provider (`~/.pi/agent/auth.json`)

- **Discord bot token** — [create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  - Enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
  - Bot permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `View Channels`, `Attach Files`

## Features

- **Bridges to your existing `pi`** — shells out to the `pi` binary and reuses your login + model access
- **Optional conversation threads** — enable per parent channel; each question gets an isolated conversation with inherited settings
- **Per-channel sessions** — each Discord channel gets its own persistent conversation history
- **Per-channel working directories** — optionally override `PI_CWD` for specific channels without changing the global default
- **Channel access policy** — `open` (all channels), `open-trigger` (all channels, @mention required), or `allowlist` (manual registration only)
- **SQLite message queue** — resumes pending work and saved answers; reports interrupted execution without replaying it
- **Concurrency control** — per-channel serial processing + configurable global limit
- **DM registration is opt-in** — direct messages are ignored until `AUTO_REGISTER_DMS=true` (a DM bypasses the channel policy, so the default stays closed)
- **Discord slash commands** — `/pi status`, `/pi model`, `/pi thinking`, `/pi new`, `/pi stop`
- **Live activity streaming** — while pi works, the bot edits a live message showing a Hermes-style activity log (tool calls, interstitial text) and optionally streamed response text (`STREAMING=tools|full|off`)
- **Bot-to-bot communication** — whitelisted peer bots can trigger the agent via @mention, with a sliding-window loop guard (`ALLOW_BOT_PEERS`)
- **Abort command** — `/pi stop` terminates the running task and clears queued messages
- **Attachment relay** — Discord file uploads are downloaded and passed to `pi` by local path so agents can inspect or convert any supported file type without flooding context
- **Message and file sending** — `piscord send` lets pi send plain text, files, or both to any Discord channel
- **Scheduled tasks** — cron or one-time tasks that trigger pi sessions on schedule
- **Archive auto-cleanup** — archived sessions are cleaned up after a configurable retention period
- **Cross-platform** — runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows with platform-aware defaults
- **Typing indicators** — shows "bot is typing" while `pi` processes
- **Message splitting** — handles Discord's 2000-character limit automatically
- **Daemon management** — systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS
- **Platform-aware paths** — XDG on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows

## How It Works

```
Discord ──discord.js──→ Gateway ──pi subprocess──→ Pi Agent
                           │                          │
                         SQLite                  Session dirs
                      (message queue)           (per channel)
```

The gateway **does not embed or replace `pi`**. It finds and runs your installed `pi`:

1. **Binary discovery** — uses `PI_BIN` config or finds `pi` in `PATH`
2. **Auth reuse** — `pi` reads its own `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` when invoked
3. **Model catalog** — cached results from asynchronous CLI discovery; a bounded, short-lived SDK probe supplies metadata and fallback models
4. **Invocation** — each message is processed as `pi --session-dir <dir> --continue -p <message>`; a short-lived supervisor terminates owned processes if the gateway exits

## Channel Policy

During setup you pick one of three policies. This controls how the bot interacts with server channels:

| Policy         | Behavior                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open`         | All guild channels auto-register on first message. No @mention needed. |
| `open-trigger` | All guild channels auto-register, but only respond when @mentioned.    |
| `allowlist`    | Only manually registered channels are active.                          |

- DMs never auto-register by default (`AUTO_REGISTER_DMS=false`): a DM bypasses
  the channel policy, so enabling it is an explicit choice.
- Use `EXCLUDED_CHANNELS` to block specific channels from auto-registration in `open` / `open-trigger` mode.

If you chose `allowlist`, register channels manually:

```bash
piscord register 123456789012345678 "my-server #general" --no-trigger
piscord register 123456789012345678 "my-server #general" --cwd /srv/repos/app
```

Re-running `piscord register` with `--cwd` updates that channel's working directory override. If no override is set, the gateway uses the global `PI_CWD`.

## Slash Commands

The gateway registers a global `/pi` command on Discord:

| Subcommand                 | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/pi status`               | Show model, thinking, working directory, session info, token usage |
| `/pi model`                | Set the channel's model (autocomplete from pi's available models)  |
| `/pi reset-model`          | Clear the channel's model override                                 |
| `/pi reset-thinking`       | Clear the thinking override and inherit the default again          |
| `/pi threads enabled:true` | Enable automatic conversation threads in this parent channel       |
| `/pi thinking`             | Set thinking level: off / minimal / low / medium / high / xhigh    |
| `/pi new`                  | Start a fresh session for this channel                             |
| `/pi stop`                 | Abort the current task and clear queued messages                   |

`/pi model` reads the catalog from the configured `PI_BIN`, so it stays in sync when pi adds or removes models. It also honors pi's `enabledModels` setting (configured through `/scoped-models`), including model order and glob patterns. If no scope is configured, it shows all available models.

In server channels, every subcommand that changes channel-wide state (`model`, `reset-model`, `thinking`, `reset-thinking`, `threads`, `new`, `stop`) requires **Manage Channels**. `/pi status` is read-only and open to everyone. Direct messages are not gated.

## Conversation Threads

Automatic thread creation is **off by default**, including after an upgrade. Enable it in a registered server text channel with `/pi threads enabled:true` (requires Manage Channels), or locally:

```bash
piscord threads 123456789012345678 on
piscord threads 123456789012345678 off
```

The bot needs **Create Public Threads** and **Send Messages in Threads**. A question that meets the parent's normal trigger rules opens a thread on that user message. The question and its attachments enter a new pi session; continue inside the thread without mentioning the bot again. A new question in the parent starts another conversation. The parent conversation's history is not copied.

Threads inherit model, thinking and working-directory settings from their parent, unless individually overridden. Parent changes apply to subsequent tasks. `/pi reset-model` and `/pi reset-thinking` restore inheritance; `/pi new` and `/pi stop` affect only the current thread. Disabling automatic threads preserves existing conversations.

Manually created threads remain usable under the channel policy. In `allowlist` mode, register a manual thread separately. Their settings inherit from a registered parent once the thread is recognized. Automatically created threads are registered by the gateway.

Scheduled prompts directed to an enabled parent channel create a brief starter message and use the same thread routing. Schedules directed to an existing thread continue there. Creation failures are reported before pi runs. Archived threads keep their sessions and can continue when Discord permits; locked or inaccessible threads may fail delivery. Deleted threads cancel pending work and disable their schedules. Their session folders are archived after active work drains, then cleaned using `ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS`. Reconciliation also checks for deletion missed while the gateway was offline.

## Task Recovery and Delivery

Stop the running gateway before upgrading. The database migration preserves existing channels, settings, sessions and pending messages. pi 0.74 is no longer supported; upgrade Node and pi together before starting this version. Setup and startup verify both the installed SDK peers and the executable selected by `PI_BIN` (or `PATH`); a missing, unsupported or unresponsive executable fails preflight.

| State at restart                  | Behavior                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waiting to execute                | Continues in queue                                                                          |
| Thread routing, before execution  | Resumes routing using the saved starter message                                             |
| Execution started, result unknown | Marked interrupted; a notice asks you to check completed operations before submitting again |
| Answer saved, delivery incomplete | Continues sending the saved answer, without rerunning pi                                    |
| Explicitly stopped or timed out   | Remains stopped                                                                             |

Answers are saved before sending. Temporary delivery failures have a bounded retry budget; confirmed chunks are skipped. Recent ambiguous sends use Discord's nonce deduplication and message lookup. If an older send cannot be confirmed, automatic delivery stops to avoid duplicates. Permission failures also stop retrying. You can read the saved answer locally with `piscord result <task-id>`; task notices include the ID. Already transmitted messages are not removed by `/pi stop`.

Only one gateway may own a database. A second instance exits with a diagnostic. After a crash, the lock can take 30 seconds to expire; an owner that is still alive is never displaced merely because its heartbeat is old. Use a local filesystem for the SQLite database and lock files.

`AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS` sets a total pi invocation limit (default `1800000` = 30 minutes; `0` preserves unlimited long tasks). Timeout and cancellation terminate the invocation and its owned subprocesses. Quiet stdout does not trigger a timeout. During shutdown, the gateway first allows `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` for active tasks, then aborts them and drains bounded process/delivery operations before closing the database.

Model discovery runs in the background and never delays a normal message for a catalog refresh. Autocomplete can briefly show an old list or no choices while loading. `/pi status` distinguishes loading, unavailable and stale catalogs. Explicit model changes wait for discovery and report unavailable discovery separately from a missing model.

## Tools for Pi

The gateway exposes two capabilities through its CLI that **pi itself can invoke**. You don't type these commands in your terminal — you just tell pi in Discord, and it handles the rest.

For example, you can say to pi:

> _"Create a daily task at 9am that generates a summary report"_
> _"Send me report.pdf with a message saying here you go"_
> _"Set a one-time reminder for the 2pm meeting today"_

pi will run the appropriate `piscord task` or `piscord send` command behind the scenes.

### Scheduled tasks

pi can schedule cron-based or one-time prompts through the gateway's scheduler. Tasks are injected into the normal message queue, so they use the channel's configured model, thinking level, and working directory.

Under the hood, pi runs commands like:

```bash
piscord task add \
  --name "daily-report" \
  --schedule "0 9 * * *" \
  --channel dc:123456789 \
  --prompt "Generate today's summary report"

piscord task add \
  --name "meeting-reminder" \
  --schedule "2026-04-05T14:00:00Z" \
  --channel dc:123456789 \
  --prompt "Remind Colin about the 2pm meeting" \
  --once
```

The `--schedule` value uses standard 5-field cron syntax (`minute hour day month weekday`). For one-time tasks, add `--once` and pass an ISO 8601 datetime.

Cron schedules are evaluated in the **gateway host's local timezone**. The same applies to `--once` ISO datetimes without an explicit UTC offset — append `Z` (e.g. `2026-09-01T09:00:00Z`) to pin them to UTC.

**Task management** — also available via pi:

```bash
piscord task list              # List all tasks
piscord task disable <id>      # Pause
piscord task enable <id>       # Resume
piscord task remove <id>       # Delete
```

### Sending messages and files to Discord

pi can send plain text messages, files, or both to any Discord channel using the gateway's built-in relay.

When you ask pi to send something, it runs commands like:

```bash
piscord send --channel dc:123456789 --text "hello"
piscord send --channel dc:123456789 --file /path/to/report.pdf --text "Here's the report"
piscord send --channel dc:123456789 --file chart.png --file data.csv
```

- `--text` works on its own
- Up to 10 files per message (Discord limit)
- Respects `MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` per file
- Works independently — no running gateway daemon required

## Daemon Management

The setup wizard offers to install a background service automatically. You can also manage it manually:

```bash
piscord daemon install   # Generate + enable service
piscord daemon start     # Start
piscord daemon status    # Check status
piscord daemon logs      # Tail log output
piscord daemon stop      # Stop
piscord daemon uninstall # Remove the service
```

- **Linux** — uses a systemd user service
- **macOS** — uses a launchd user agent
- **Windows** — daemon management is not yet supported; run `piscord start` in a terminal or use Task Scheduler manually

> **Headless Linux servers**: enable user lingering so the service runs without an active login session:
>
> ```bash
> sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
> ```

## Configuration Reference

Config file location depends on your OS (see Data Locations). On Linux: `~/.config/pi-discord-gateway/config.env`

Most users won't need to edit this file directly — `piscord setup` generates it for you. If you do want to tweak advanced settings, you can edit the file manually, or ask your pi to configure it for you. Run `piscord status` to see the config path on your system.

| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Config   | `~/.config/pi-discord-gateway/config.env`   | `~/Library/Application Support/piscord-gateway/config.env` | `%APPDATA%\piscord-gateway\config.env`      |
| Database | `~/.local/share/piscord-gateway/gateway.db` | `~/Library/Application Support/piscord-gateway/gateway.db` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\piscord-gateway\gateway.db` |

## Alternative Installation

### npx (quick trial, no global install)

```bash
npx piscord@latest setup
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Crokily/pi-discord-gateway.git
cd pi-discord-gateway
npm install && npm run build
node dist/cli/index.js setup
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>pi not found in PATH</strong></summary>

`piscord status` shows "Pi binary: not found".

- Check `pi --version` works in the same shell
- Set `PI_BIN=/full/path/to/pi` in config.env
- Restart: `piscord daemon stop && piscord daemon start`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Missing auth.json</strong></summary>

`piscord status` shows "Pi auth: missing".

- Run `pi` and complete the login flow
- Confirm `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` exists for the same user running the gateway
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Daemon service won't start</strong></summary>

- `piscord daemon status` — check for errors
- `piscord daemon logs` — see log output
- **Linux**: for headless servers, run `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`
- **macOS**: check `~/Library/Logs/piscord-gateway/` for launchd output
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Bot is online but doesn't respond</strong></summary>

- `open` policy: check `EXCLUDED_CHANNELS` doesn't include your channel
- `allowlist` policy: run `piscord channels` — at least one channel must be registered
- For trigger-only channels: mention the bot by name or use `@TriggerName`
- DMs auto-register when `AUTO_REGISTER_DMS=true`
</details>

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Start with tsx (no build needed)
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
npm test             # Run Vitest suite
npm run typecheck    # Check source and test types
npm run test:compat  # Exercise installed pi with an isolated local model fixture
```

## Security

- Protect `config.env` — it contains your Discord bot token
- Anyone who can message a registered channel can spend your pi usage
- Review attachment size limits before exposing the bot
- Run the service as a normal user, not root
